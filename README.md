# BE Model Agents
**By Steven Garis, Orion Wills, Jason Dunn, and Michael Moran**

BE Model Agents is our capstone project for Codeup's Data Science course. The project consists of an analysis of real estate transaction data provided by Brokerage Engine, a San Antonio company offering software services to help brokerages manage the relationships with their agents.

## Repository Contents
address_to_zip.py - a script for correcting address information using Google's Geolocation API
BE_model_agents.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook containing our analysis and model
BE_model_agents.py - a Python script with the same contents as the notebook minus
rf_model_agents.obj - a pickled object containing the model
webapp/ - deployment of the model in a web interface

## How to Use
Given the sensitive nature of the data underlying this project, we cannot make it available and have removed some facets of our analysis. If you would like a demonstration of the project, please contact one of the authors.
